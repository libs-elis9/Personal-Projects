This is a compilation of several projects in Python that interested me.

**Solving the Towers of Hanoi:**
This was an exploration of the Towers of Hanoi. The game uses three rods and several disks of different sizes. The goal is to move all the disks from the first rod to the third rod. You cannot place a smaller disk on top of a larger disk. I used recursion to simplify this into just a few lines.

**Cracking the Vigenère Cipher:**
The Vigenère Cipher uses a keyword, where each letter tells you how many places to shift the letters in the message. This algorithm first estimates the key’s length, then analyzes letter frequencies in each segment to calculate the shifts and recover the original message.

**Exploration of Rearrangements:**
This is based on the idea that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to any real number. The code plots the original series of partial sums, then takes a list of real numbers as input and rearranges the series to converge to each of them.

**Drawing Hilbert's Curve:**
This algorithm uses recursion and the Turtle graphics module to draw a Hilbert space-filling curve. The curve is constructed by recursively combining four smaller versions of itself, each rotated and positioned to fill a square without overlaps or gaps. As the recursion depth increases, the curve becomes more detailed, eventually covering the entire area of the square.
