This is a compilation of several projects in Python that interested me.

**Solving the Towers of Hanoi:**
This was an exploration of the Towers of Hanoi. The game uses three rods and several disks of different sizes. The goal is to move all the disks from the first rod to the third rod. You cannot place a smaller disk on top of a larger disk. I used recursion to simplify this into just a few lines.

**Cracking the Vigenère Cipher**
The Vigenère Cipher uses a keyword, where each letter tells you how many places to shift the letters in the message. This algorithm first estimates the key’s length, then analyzes letter frequencies in each segment to calculate the shifts and recover the original message.
